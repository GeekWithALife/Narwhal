-- Narwhal Themes System --
----------------------------

General Info:
	Narwhal Themes are basically like Derma Skins for your Gamemode.
	Themes work a lot like modules, except only one can be active at a time.
	Most of the time, themes will just be a handy way of grouping hooks for mass hooking/unhooking/rehooking.
	You can also have Theme bases.
	
Narwhal Functions:
	NARWHAL.GetTheme( themeName )
		Gets the theme data for the named theme.
	NARWHAL.GetThemes()
		Gets a table containing all themes.
	NARWHAL:CurrentTheme()
		Returns the name of the current theme.
	NARWHAL:SetTheme( themeName )
		Sets the gamemode theme by name.
	NARWHAL:ForceTheme()
		Called on gamemode initialize to set the initial theme for the gamemode.
	NARWHAL:ThemeChanged( oldTheme, newTheme )
		Called when SetTheme is called, and passes the old theme and the new theme as values.
		If it returns false, then the new theme won't get set.

THEME Functions:
	THEME:Hook( hookName, uniqueName, func )
		hook.Add doesn't work when themes are being loaded, so you need to use this instead.
	THEME:UnHook( hookName, uniqueName )
		Use this instead of hook.Remove.
	THEME:HookAll()
		Hooks all the theme hooks for this theme.
	THEME:UnHookAll()
		Unhooks all the theme hooks for this theme. You can rehook them by using THEME:HookAll().
	THEME:__Call( funcName, ... )
		DO NOT CALL THIS! It is called internally to protect the execution of all non-hooked theme methods.
	THEME:__GenerateFunctionCalls()
		DO NOT CALL THIS! It is called internally to generate a list of functions to be used by THEME:__Call( funcName, ... ).
	 THEME:__GenerateHooks()
		DO NOT CALL THIS! It is called internally to automatically hook THEME methods that are named as gamemode hooks. This will only work if THEME.AutoHook is true.
	THEME:OnThemeChanged( newTheme )
		Called when the theme is being changed if NARWHAL:ThemeChanged( oldTheme, newTheme ) returns true.
	
THEME Values:
	THEME.__ThemeHooks - Table containing theme hook data.
	THEME.__HookName - The folder name that contains the theme files. This ensures a unique theme name.
	THEME.__Functions - Table containing a copy of every custom function that is a member of the THEME table. This is used for protected calls on theme functions.
	THEME.__Protected - Table containing the names of functions in the THEME table that are restricted from use in THEME:__Call( funcName, ... ).
	THEME.BaseClass - If the theme has a base, this is that base theme's THEME table. Otherwise this is the GAMEMODE table.
	THEME.Name - The nice name of the theme.
	THEME.Base - The base, and workes exactly the same way DeriveGamemode does. This is not required.
	THEME.Author - The name of the author.
	THEME.Contact - The author's contact.
	THEME.Description - The theme description.
